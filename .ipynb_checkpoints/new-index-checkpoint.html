            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a second-year MS student studying computer science at the University of Colorado. In 2021 I recieved my Bachelor of Science in computer science and mathematics from Texas State University. My undergraduate thesis was entitled, "The Hidden Shape of Data: Topological Data Analysis for Anxiety Detection in Text," and can be accessed online via the <a href="https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/13762">Texas State honors program online thesis library</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Very broadly, my research interests lie in the area of topological data analysis (TDA) for time-evolving metric spaces. A deeper description of my research can be found under my <a href="#work">Portfolio</a> section. I am currently applying for the NSF graduate research fellowship. After completing my Masters degree I plan to continue on to a Ph.D., likely also from the University of Colorado.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I was at Texas State, I also had the privilege of being the Digital Product Developer for the student-lead newspaper, <a href="https://www.universitystar.com/"> The University Star </a>. In this role, I oversaw the management of all of The Star's digital assets, including the management and design of the website and app. I assisted with overhauling the Star's website and ensuring that the new site was WCAG 2.0 compliant. In spring 2021, I earned second place in overall web design at the Texas Intercollegiate Press Association (TIPA).
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy spending any free time I have as far away from technology as possible. My hobbies include reading (especially high fantasy), watercolor, hiking, and trying out new baking recipes. A fun fact about myself is that I can recite the first fourty one digits of pi from memory.

               While I am not very good at keeping it up to date, you can find portions of my code on <a href="https://github.com/mbyers31">my Github</a>. If you are looking for the code that corresponds to a particular paper of mine, check my <a href="#pub">publications section</a> below. When applicable, I will include links to the repository where you can find code corresponding to each of my works.

                I spent most of my undergraduate career working on projects for class or for my work at the IMICS lab. If you are a Texas State student or faculty member, you may <a href="https://git.txstate.edu/meb298">access the work that I did on behalf of Texas State here</a>.
