<p>Most of my time is spent working on projects for my classes or for the IMICS lab at Texas State University. If you are a Texas State student or faculty member, you may <a href="https://git.txstate.edu/meb298">access the work that I do on behalf of Texas State here.</a></p>
<p>In my free time, I work on scraps of projects here and there. You can find my personal work on <a href="https://github.com/mbyers31">my personal Github account.</a></p>
